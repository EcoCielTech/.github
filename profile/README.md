# EcoCiel: Pioneering Sustainable Solutions

## About EcoCiel

EcoCiel is not just a platform; it's a movement towards a greener, more sustainable future. Our ethos revolves around leveraging technology to inspire and incentivize eco-conscious behaviors, uniting individuals and businesses in a shared commitment to environmental stewardship. At the core of our mission is the belief that every action, no matter how small, contributes to a collective impact on our planet.

### Real-time Analytical Graph (RAG) Model: Unraveling Environmental Insights

Central to EcoCiel's functionality is the groundbreaking Real-time Analytical Graph (RAG) Model. Built upon Azure DataPipeline and Azure Data Warehouse, this model serves as the nerve center of our platform, orchestrating the assimilation and analysis of disparate data streams. From streaming weather updates and UV data to air quality indices and financial metrics, the RAG Model paints a vivid picture of our environment's health and vitality.

#### Empowering Personalized Challenges with Precision

The efficacy of our RAG Model is further amplified by a sophisticated classifier model, meticulously calibrated to discern nuanced user preferences. After exhaustive experimentation, we've adopted an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model for its unparalleled accuracy in crafting personalized sustainability challenges. By understanding the unique inclinations and habits of each user, EcoCiel delivers tailored initiatives that resonate deeply, fostering sustained engagement and impact.

### RNN for Air Quality Index Monitoring: Breathing Life into Data

In tandem with our RAG Model, EcoCiel harnesses the power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to monitor Air Quality Index (AQI) in real-time. This cutting-edge feature, fueled by streaming machine learning data, provides users with actionable insights into air quality dynamics, empowering informed decision-making and proactive measures to safeguard health and well-being.
